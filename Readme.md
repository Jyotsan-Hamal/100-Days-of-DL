# Deep Learning

This repository is a collection of notes, code, and resources related to my study of deep learning. I will be updating this repository on a weekly basis with my progress in learning and applying deep learning concepts.

## Introduction

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on building and training neural networks with multiple layers. These networks are capable of learning and representing complex patterns in data, and are widely used in various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics.

## Goals

The goals of this repository are:

- To gain a deeper understanding of deep learning concepts and techniques.
- To apply deep learning to solve real-world problems.
- To build a portfolio of deep learning projects that demonstrate my skills and knowledge.






## Topics Covered

Over the course of my deep learning study, I will cover a range of topics, including:

- Neural networks and their architectures
- Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
- Deep reinforcement learning
- Generative models (e.g. GANs)
- loss function
- Transfer learning
- Hyperparameter tuning and optimization

## Mathematical Intuition

I will also provide mathematical intuition and explanations for deep learning concepts to help understand the underlying mathematics behind the models.

## Acknowledgments

I want to thank the online deep learning community for their resources, tutorials, and support.
